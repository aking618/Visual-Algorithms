# Visual Algorithms React Addition

This project is a web based application built using React JS. The goal of this project is to gain experience and knowledge of the React framework as well as web development as a whole.

# What is Visual Algorithms?
Visual Algorithms attempts to visualize different sorting algorithms through what I call "data bars". These data bars are rectangles, whose height is indicative of a random value. A collection of data bars are produced and a sorting algorithms then sorts these data bars in order. This it a showcase of knowledge of different algorithms, knowledge of web-development, and knowledge of the ReactJS framework.

# Inspiration
This project is heavily inspired by [Timo Bingmann on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9m2XDfCnrS4QTzVBTrD89w) and his VERY famous [sorting algorithms video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg&t). This projects aims to replicate, but add a little personal spice ;), to his work.
